Alex Hornstein
Wireless Twitter Printer
5.6.12
an Ocean Invention project


This project is a small printer that connects to the internet over wifi,
grabs the latest tweets on a topic of your choosing, and prints them out
on a strip of paper.  The printer is just like the receipt printers at 
7/11.  It uses rolls of thermal paper that you can get at any office supply store

Here's an early video of it working:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRoUT3GHlHI

I used the wifly shield because it's awesome.  It worked
right out of the box for me, and now the only cable going to my project is a small power cord from
a wall wart.  With a couple D batteries, you could totally make this thing battery-powered, too.  Oooh!
Or solar!

The total project cost me $130, not counting the arduino.  I've printed out hundreds of feet of tweets, and still counting!

I originally made this printer as a collaboration tool between my new lab in Manila and our partner lab in Hong Kong, so we could
share ideas in a way that was cooler and more engaging than email.  The plan was to stick one of these printers on the ceiling of 
anyone we're working with, and whenever anyone had an idea they wanted to share, they'd tweet it with the hashtag #oceanInvention 
(that's our network of invention labs).  The idea would then instantly print out from all the printers, all over the world.

Since I was using twitter as a back-end for the project, I decided I might as well make the printer a generic tweet-printer.  
I wanted to make it easy to change the twitter topic that the printer prints out, so I gave each printer a unique name and made a 
website where you enter a topic for your printer (at artiswrong.com/oceanPrinter).  The printer checks the website before searching 
twitter, so you can change the topics on-the-fly.

There's lots of other thermal printer projects out there, including Adafruit's awesome Internet-of-things printer:  https://www.adafruit.com/products/717)
To my knowledge, this is the only wifi printer out there, and that makes it special.  I'm also kinda in love with my on-the-fly topic 
change idea.  
There are some people who made an amazing project called GoFreeRange to control these printers and send all kinds of feeds and messages 
to them, as well as graphics and other pretty things.  I took a look at it and got confused and intimidated.  
Maybe you'll have more luck:  http://gofreerange.com/hello-printer

Here's all the parts you need to make this:
++ Thermal printer, $50 from sparkfun (http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10438) or adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/products/597)

++ Wifly wireless internet shield, $80 from sparkfun (http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9954)

++ Arduino.  I used a seeeduino duemilanove clone with an atmega328, but an uno would work fine as well.  I would stick to processors with a atmega328
processor or better.  Grab one from adafruit(https://www.adafruit.com/products/50) or sparkfun(http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10356) or seeed studios(http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/seeeduino-v30-atmega-328p-p-669.html?cPath=132_133) for ~$30

++  Stackable arduino header kit.  The wifly shield doesn't come with headers, so you'll need to solder some on.  Takes about 5 minutes.  
$1.50 from Sparkfun (http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10007) or adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/products/85)


code stuff:
all you have to do to configure this code is to set the wireless internet ssid and password (if it's an open network, just use '0' 
for the password).  Give the printer a unique name, and upload that sketch!
The printer itself has five wires coming out:  power, ground, serial TX, serial RX, and another ground.
Connect the ground to the arduino ground, you'll need a beefy 5-9V supply to power the printer, and connect the RX (the green) wire
to pin 2 of the arduino and the TX (yellow) wire to pin 3.  You should be good to go.

The printer can search for and print out any topic you like on twitter.  To set the topic for your printer, go to 
artiswrong.com/oceanPrinter/
Type in your printer name and the topic.  If you want to change the topic, just type in whatever you want and resubmit the form.  The
printer automatically checks the website before searching twitter, so your updates should be instantaneous.


The arduino will work by itself, but you can listen to it over the serial connection at 115200 baud and hear all the chatter going 
back and forth to the various websites.

Libraries:
I use ladyada's AWESOME thermal printer library (download it here:  https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Thermal-Printer-Library)
and the alpha 1 release of Sparkfun's Wifly library (download it here:  http://sparkfun.com/Code/wifly/WiFly-20100831-alpha-1.zip)

If you have any questions/suggestions, ping me at alex@manilamantis.com
If you're interested in contributing to the code, holler at me and I'll add you to the project.  Contributors are WELCOME!

IMPORTANT---this code will NOT compile on arduino 1.0.  The wifly library isn't
arduino 1.0 compatible.  I developed and tested on arduino 0022, and it works just
fine.  Save yourself a world o hurt and grab arduino 0022 from http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
